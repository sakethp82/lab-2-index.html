        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The field of cybersecurity has changed dramatically since the Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade was presented by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in December 2020. The Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the potential of AI as a new technology, but also the need for cyber security of AI technology. Indeed, since the strategy was adopted, AI has shown that it has enormous potential for growth, but also several risks and vulnerabilities that this new technology brings. The paper analyses the shift and further development in the field of cybersecurity of digital products and services, AI itself as a technology, as well as products and services that will contain an AI component.

        <h2>Introduction: Digital Resilience from Organisations to Products and Services</h2>
        <p>To build trust in digital services and products, including elements such as AI technologies, they must be properly designed and provide an acceptable level of security and privacy. Cybersecurity plays a key role for all stakeholders in building trust in digital products and services. Surveys show universal agreement on the importance of digital trust.

        <h2>AIA as Cybersecurity Law</h2>
        <p>The AIA can be considered a cybersecurity law due to its comprehensive approach to ensuring the security and trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems. The AIA addresses the cybersecurity of AI systems from both narrow and broad perspectives...</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Cybersecurity Certification</h2>
        <p>The CSA for the first time introduced European rules for cybersecurity certification of products, processes, and services. Once the EU-wide certification framework is put in place, it should minimise barriers to current certification schemes for ICT products and services existing within the EU...</p>

        <h2>Evaluating the Cybersecurity of AI Systems</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity of AI extends beyond traditional digital asset protection and encompasses unique challenges and considerations related to the nature of AI systems. As one of the seven key requirements for trustworthy AI, ensuring the cybersecurity of AI involves the following key dimensions:

        <h2>Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Security Measures of AI Systems Across the Lifecycle</h2>
        <p>The assets of AI systems, particularly machine learning algorithms, face a series of threats and vulnerabilities from conception to production and throughout their entire lifecycle. These risks can compromise the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI applications.

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Standardisation of Cybersecurity for AI</h2>
        <p>The EU's standardisation strategy aims at ensuring that technologies such as artificial intelligence incorporate respect for human rights, core democratic values.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Technical standards have become increasingly significant in the legal framework of the European Union, particularly in the context of cybersecurity and AI regulation. Although formally voluntary, harmonized standards effectively serve as binding elements, shaping the interpretation and application of legal requirements.</p>

        <h3>Addendum: Future Challenges in Cybersecurity for AI</h3>
        <p>The rapid evolution of AI technologies will continue to present new challenges in cybersecurity. Future efforts must focus on integrating ethical guidelines, ensuring data privacy in AI applications, and providing transparent security certifications for emerging AI systems. Moreover, the collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and research institutions will be pivotal in establishing effective global standards for AI cybersecurity.</p>
